		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>Expeditions Adventure Travel was founded by adventurers for adventurers. We have traveled to some of the most exotic locations around the world and we would love for you to explore them too. What this means for you, the traveler, is that we have first-hand knowledge of many locations. This means we can guide you through the trip planning process.</p>

When I Was a Kid We Had Nine Planets

[Paragraph Text]

Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. After Pluto was discovered in 1930 it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun. From 1992 onward, many bodies were discovered orbiting in the same volume as Pluto, showing that Pluto is part of a population of objects called the Kuiper belt. This made its official status as a planet controversial. Pluto is now considered a minor planet.

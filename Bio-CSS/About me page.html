		<h2 >Major Life Events</h2>
		<p >One Problem that I have had to deal with in my life is my battle with anxiety. from a around the age of 14 I started to suffer with really bad anxiety and never really started to work on it until my junior year of high school. The thing I used to help control my anxiety was taking medication to help control the chemicals released when I start to get anxiety.</p>
		<p >I have also gotten a major award that many people know. and that is the Eagle Scout award in boy school. for me to recieve this reward I had to plan and operate my own service project. For mine id did first aid kits for my school district with a bunch of first aid stuff for if there is a mass injury incident at the schools. I did this with the school nurses to make sure all the teachers would be trained to use them.</p>
